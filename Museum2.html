        <p>
          <em
            >Thutmose III (sometimes written as Thutmosis or Tuthmosis, in
            Egyptian hieroglyphs: 𓅝𓄟𓄤𓆣), also known as Thutmose the Great,
            (1479–1425 BCE), was the fifth pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty in
            ancient Egypt. He is considered one of the greatest warriors,
            military commanders, and strategists in history, known as Egypt’s
            first true fighting pharaoh and the most prominent conqueror of the
            New Kingdom. Thutmose III officially ruled Egypt from his coronation
            on April 28, 1479 BCE, when he was two years old, until his death on
            March 11, 1425 BCE. However, the first 22 years of his reign were a
            co-regency with his stepmother and aunt, Hatshepsut, who held the
            title of pharaoh. After Hatshepsut’s death in 1458 BCE, Thutmose III
            became the sole ruler of Egypt. He led between 17 and 20 military
            campaigns, all victorious, bringing the Egyptian Empire to the peak
            of its expansion and power. The details of these campaigns are
            recorded in the inscriptions known as the Annals of Thutmose III. He
            is also credited with founding the ancient Egyptian navy, considered
            the first organized naval fleet in ancient history. Historian
            Richard A. Gabriel described him as “Napoleon of Egypt.” Two years
            before his death, after the death of his eldest son and heir
            Amenemhat, Thutmose III appointed his other son, Amenhotep II, as
            co-regent and designated successor.</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>His military life</b>
          <br />
          Thutmose III focused on the army, making it professional and equipping
          it with cavalry and war chariots. During his reign, the ancient
          Egyptians, thanks to him, mastered the craft of making bows and
          arrows. In contrast to Thutmose’s era, when Hatshepsut ruled, she
          followed a peaceful policy with the Egyptian spheres of influence in
          Palestine and Nubia and with neighboring regions. She focused on the
          navy and sent maritime expeditions to the land of Punt and to the
          coasts of Lebanon for trade. Some protectorates in Syria and Mitanni
          seized the opportunity to rebel against Egyptian rule. As soon as
          Thutmose III ascended the throne after Hatshepsut’s death, he had to
          restore Egyptian control over those regions to secure the country’s
          borders. He launched **sixteen military campaigns** in Asia (the
          regions of Syria and Palestine), through which he consolidated his
          influence there and extended Egypt’s control as far south as Nubia.
          The prince of the city of **Kadesh** in Syria led a coalition of Asian
          princes in the Levant against Egypt, numbering **twenty-three
          armies**. It was expected that Thutmose III would reinforce his
          defenses and forces on the Egyptian border near Sinai. However,
          Thutmose decided to march with his massive armies to confront these
          forces on their own soil, as part of a plan to expand the Egyptian
          Empire to its maximum possible extent and secure the borders against
          hostile armies.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Battle of Megiddo</b>
          <br />
          Thutmose III built fortresses and strongholds, trained his soldiers
          with the best drills, and supplied them with powerful innovative
          weapons such as advanced bows and arrows and expanded the use of
          chariots in battle. In the **Battle of Megiddo** campaign, he divided
          his army into a center and two wings and employed military tactics and
          maneuvers that were previously unknown. He then led his army from
          Qantara, covering **150 miles in ten days**, reaching Gaza. From
          there, he marched another **80 miles in eleven days** between Gaza and
          one of the cities at the foot of Mount Carmel. There, Thutmose III
          held a war council with his officers after learning that the prince of
          Kadesh had come to the city of **Megiddo** and gathered around him
          **230 princes** with their armies. They encamped in the fortified city
          of Megiddo to halt the advance of Thutmose III and his forces. There
          were **three routes** to reach Megiddo: two of them circled around the
          base of Mount Carmel, while the third was a narrow pass but led
          directly to Megiddo. Thutmose decided that the army would take the
          third pass—a daring move that later turned the tide of the battle. The
          forces of the prince of Kadesh and his allies had positioned
          themselves at the end of the two wide roads, believing that the
          Egyptian army would come from one or both of them. At dawn the next
          day, King Thutmose III ordered the army to reassemble the war chariots
          and prepare for a surprise attack. His forces charged, with Thutmose
          at the front leading in a **semicircular formation** toward Megiddo.
          The surprise was that the Egyptians launched this overwhelming
          assault, throwing the enemy into confusion and disarray. Their armies
          fell into chaos and disorder, and the commanders and troops began to
          flee, abandoning their large chariots and their camp filled with
          spoils, to take refuge inside the fortified city. Because the Egyptian
          soldiers became preoccupied with collecting the spoils, the Asians
          were able to escape into the city and fortify themselves there. The
          consequence of the army’s distraction with gathering loot—when they
          could have completely destroyed the forces of the prince of Kadesh and
          achieved total victory—was that Thutmose III was forced to **besiege
          Megiddo for seven long months** until the princes surrendered. They
          sent their sons carrying weapons to surrender them to King Thutmose
          III.
        </p>

          <b>His architectural works</b>
          <br />
          Thutmose III built numerous temples in Thebes, including two, one of
          which was adjacent to Hatshepsut’s temple at Deir el-Bahri. He also
          constructed the massive **sixth and seventh pylons** and the
          **Festival Hall** at the Karnak Temple, completed the Temple of Hapou
          that Hatshepsut had begun, and erected a temple to the god **Ptah** in
          his homeland at Memphis. This temple contains three chambers: the
          first for Ptah, the second for **Hathor**, goddess of Thebes, and the
          third for the goddess **Sekhmet**, wife of Ptah, represented by a
          statue of her with a lioness head crowned with a sun disk. He also had
          temples in **Amada** and **Semna**, built a temple on **Elephantine**
          for the goddess **Satet**, and left remains in **Kom Ombo**, **Edfu**,
          **Heliopolis**, and **Armant**. Thutmose III erected **at least seven
          obelisks**, most of which are now in various world capitals: - The
          obelisk in **London** (one of two he erected in front of the Sun
          Temple at Heliopolis). A Greek engineer named **Pontius** moved both
          to Alexandria to place them before the Temple of Isis. This obelisk
          fell from its base in the 14th century CE. It is said that **Muhammad
          Ali Pasha** gifted it to Britain in **1831 CE**, but it did not arrive
          in London until **1878 CE**, having lain on the ground all that time
          due to transportation difficulties. **Sir Erasmus Wilson** funded its
          transport and built a special ship for it. The ship nearly sank in a
          storm in the **Bay of Biscay**, but the obelisk was saved and arrived
          safely. Notably, this obelisk was damaged by shrapnel during World War
          II on the **River Thames**. It is known as **Cleopatra’s Needle**,
          though it was originally erected by Thutmose III in front of the
          Heliopolis temple. - Another obelisk, now in **Istanbul**, is one of
          two Thutmose erected before the **seventh pylon** (a grand gateway) at
          Karnak Temple. Emperor **Theodosius** moved it in **510 CE**. In fact,
          this obelisk represents only the **upper part** of a much taller
          original—longer than any obelisk existing today. - Another obelisk is
          in **New York**, erected by Thutmose in front of the Sun Temple. It is
          the **twin** of the London obelisk and now stands in **Central Park**.
          - In his later years, Thutmose ordered an obelisk to be placed before
          the **eighth pylon** at Karnak, but it was left unfinished due to his
          death. It remained in place for **35 years** until **Thutmose IV**
          discovered it and erected it in its intended location. It is now in
          **Rome** in front of the **Basilica of St. John Lateran**.
          **Constantine the Great**, ruler of the Roman Empire, moved this
          **455-ton** obelisk to Alexandria in **330 CE** to send it to
          Byzantium to beautify his new capital, but failed to transport it
          further. It remained there for **27 years** until his son
          **Constantius** moved it to Rome and erected it in the **Circus
          Maximus**. In **1587 CE**, it was rediscovered, broken into **three
          pieces**. **Domenico Fontana** repaired and restored it on the orders
          of **Pope Sixtus V** and installed it in its current location in the
          **Lateran Square**. He also ordered a **cross** to be placed on top,
          believing it symbolized the **triumph of Christianity over paganism**.

            >King Menes (Egyptian: Mani; Ancient Greek: Μήνης; English: Menes)
            was an ancient Egyptian king from the Early Dynastic Period, one of
            the kings of Egypt during the Early Dynastic Period in ancient
            Egypt. He is credited with unifying Upper and Lower Egypt and is
            considered the founder of the First Dynasty. Menes' identity is a
            subject of debate among Egyptologists. Some attribute it to King
            Hor-Aha, while others link it to King Narmer. Both pharaohs are
            credited with unifying Egypt to varying degrees by different
            authorities.</em

          <br />
          King Menes, Unifier of the Two Lands, was an Egyptian king from the
          First Egyptian Dynasty in the city of Thebes (modern Luxor). He
          succeeded in unifying the Two Lands (the northern and southern
          kingdoms) around 3200 BCE. For this great achievement, he was granted
          several titles, such as "King of the Two Lands," "Lord of the Two
          Crowns," "Falcon of the South," and "Cobra of the North." King Menes
          is considered the founder of the First Dynasty of ancient Egyptian
          kings.

        <p>
          <b>Origin of the name</b>
          <br />
          The name Menes is mentioned in some ancient Egyptian writings as
          (Meni), and the Egyptians later altered the name to Mena. Strangely,
          the word (Meni) means "to establish" or "to build" in the ancient
          Egyptian language, as if the Egyptians wanted to honor his achievement
          in his name. Some historians confirm that (Meni) is a verb or title,
          not a personal name. In the Coptic (Egyptian) language, the name Mena
          has many synonyms, including (stable, firm, established, enduring,
          lasting, or founder). Thus, Mena is considered the doer of the verb
          "Meni" in the Egyptian language. The commonly used name Mena derives
          from Manetho, an Egyptian historian and priest who lived during the
          Ptolemaic Kingdom. Manetho recorded the name in Greek as Μήνης
          (translated: Mênês). An alternative Greek form, Μιν (phonetically
          translated: Min), was cited by the 5th-century BCE historian
          Herodotus, but this variant is no longer accepted; it appears to have
          resulted from contamination with the name of the god Min. The Egyptian
          form, mnj, is taken from the king lists in Turin and Abydos, dating to
          the Nineteenth Dynasty, with its pronunciation reconstructed as
          */maˈnij/. By the early New Kingdom, changes in the Egyptian language
          led to the name being pronounced */maˈneʔ/. The name mnj means "he who
          endures," which I. E. S. Edwards (1971) suggests may have been coined
          as "merely a descriptive epithet referring to a semi-legendary hero
          [...] whose [personal] name has been lost." Rather than a specific
          individual's name, it may collectively refer to the Naqada III rulers:
          Ka, Scorpion II, and Narmer.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Creation of the White Wall Fortress</b>
          <br />
          King Menes thought of choosing a site that lay midway between the
          kingdoms of the North and South so that he could rule Egypt from it.
          He established a fortress surrounded by a white wall and named it
          **Men-nefer**, meaning "the beautiful harbor" or "the white wall."
          Part of it still remains to this day. Memphis became the first capital
          of Egypt after unification. However, due to the strong influence of
          the southern city kings, Memphis did not become firmly established as
          the capital of the country, nor did it reach the height of its power
          and rule until the Old Kingdom era. Later, the Greeks called it
          **Memphis** or "the Way of the Rams." When the Arabs conquered Egypt,
          they named it **Menf**, and it is now the area of **Mit Rahina**,
          which belongs to the city and center of **Badrshein** in **Giza
          Governorate**.

        <p>
          <b>Hor-Aha</b>
          <br />
          Hor-Aha is the name of the king who succeeded King Menes. It belongs
          to the Horus name category among royal titles. The meaning of Hor-Aha
          is "Horus who fights." It is called the Horus name in reference to the
          god Horus, and it is written inside the serekh sign—which represents
          the palace facade and was later used to mean "palace" (as transmitted
          by the Hebrews to the Arabs as "sarh"). It is also called the Ka name
          in reference to the Ka. It is one of the oldest names, used by kings
          of the Predynastic period. He is considered the earthly embodiment of
          the god Horus, the most important deity in the lives of the ancient
          Egyptians.

        <p>
          <em
            >Queen Nefertiti, whose name means "the beautiful one has come," was
            the wife of King Amenhotep IV (who later became Akhenaten), the
            famous pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty, and the mother-in-law of
            Tutankhamun. She was considered one of the most powerful women in
            ancient Egypt. She lived for a short time after her husband's death
            and helped Tutankhamun ascend to the throne. This beautiful queen
            held a high status during her husband's reign. She belonged to the
            Eighteenth Dynasty and lived in the 14th century BCE. Like what
            happened with her husband, her name was erased from historical
            records and her images were defaced after her death. Nefertiti
            became famous for the painted limestone bust of her face, one of the
            finest works of art from the ancient era and the most famous
            depiction of Queen Nefertiti.</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Her life</b>
          Queen Nefertiti shared with her husband the worship of the new
          religion, which was the cult of Aten, the power of the sun disk. She
          and her husband were the intermediaries between the people and Aten.
          It was assumed that full blessings were granted only when the royal
          couple united. During the early years of her husband's reign,
          Nefertiti changed her name in accordance with her new faith to
          Neferneferuaten Nefertiti, meaning "Aten shines because the beautiful
          one has come." Nefertiti supported her husband during the religious
          and social reforms, then moved with him to Akhetaten (Tell el-Amarna).
          She appeared with him during celebrations and rituals, in family
          scenes, and even in traditional depictions of military campaigns,
          where she was shown defeating enemies.

            >Her bust "bust = half-statue (of the face, neck, and shoulders)"</b
          >
          Nefertiti is remembered for the painted and sculpted limestone bust of
          her face, one of the finest works of art from the ancient era and the
          most famous depiction of Queen Nefertiti. It was discovered by the
          German Egyptologist **Ludwig Borchardt** on December 6, 1912, in the
          workshop of the sculptor Thutmose at Tell el-Amarna. Borchardt
          smuggled the complete (undamaged) bust to his home in the Zamalek
          district of Cairo, and from there, he shipped it to Germany, hidden
          among worthless broken pottery pieces sent to Berlin for restoration.
          Another bust of Nefertiti’s head, made of red quartzite and decorated
          with ink touches, exists in the Egyptian Museum. It is no less precise
          in craftsmanship than the one in Berlin but is less famous. It is
          still unknown whether a mummy of Queen Nefertiti exists. What is
          certain is that scientists found mummies in a secret chamber in
          Akhenaten’s tomb. In the 19th century, French archaeologist **Victor
          Loret**, while opening one of the crypt walls, discovered a side
          chamber containing three mummies: one male and two female, one younger
          than the other. At the time, these mummies attracted little attention.
          They were photographed in 1907 and then forgotten. Recently, however,
          doubts have arisen among scholars that one of these two female mummies
          might be Nefertiti. In 2002, British researcher **Joann Fletcher**
          from the University of York, an expert in mummies, announced that the
          remains of the younger mummy belonged to Queen Nefertiti, stating it
          was an indisputable fact. Joyfully, she called it "the greatest
          discovery of my life!" after being allowed to subject the mummy to
          X-ray examinations. The strongest evidence that one of these mummies
          is "the beautiful one who has come" lies in the high quality of the
          embalming and the anatomical resemblance to known descriptions of
          Nefertiti’s remains—at least as Fletcher saw it in the neck,
          shoulders, and especially the face. The mummy was bald, shaved to wear
          a special wig, and Fletcher appears to have found the wig. However,
          this claim later became highly controversial and disputed by Egyptian
          authorities. Examinations also revealed traces of a leather headband
          imprinted on the mummy’s forehead and evidence of two earrings in the
          left ear—features previously seen in some images of the queen. Shortly
          afterward, a broken hand was found near the mummy, holding a scepter—a
          known symbol of pharaonic authority. Thus, Joann Fletcher had no doubt
          that Nefertiti’s remains had finally been found. In contrast, her
          colleagues expressed skepticism, believing the remains were merely
          those of a young woman from the royal family who died during the 18th
          Dynasty. Dr. **Zahi Hawass**, former Egyptian Minister of State for
          Antiquities and now Secretary-General of the Supreme Council of
          Antiquities—considered the leading Egyptologist—criticized Fletcher,
          asserting that the mummy she referred to belonged to a girl aged
          16–20, while Queen Nefertiti was older. Currently, Egyptologists are
          studying the second female mummy from Akhenaten’s tomb. Here too,
          similarities with the queen can be noted, and the final word may come
          from DNA analysis. Such tests have already helped identify both
          Tutankhamun’s grandmother and Akhenaten himself, who was indeed
          Tutankhamun’s father. The question remains: Is the mummy known as
          **KV35YL** Queen Nefertiti? Perhaps. Or perhaps not. Doubts about her
          maternity are not directed only at her but also at Akhenaten’s sister.
          It is known that Nefertiti was his primary wife.

        <p>
          <b>End of her life</b>
          One of their daughters, Meketaten, died, and their grief over her was
          depicted in some wall paintings. After their daughter's death,
          Nefertiti disappeared from the royal court, and her daughter Meritaten
          took her place, receiving the title of Great Royal Wife. After the
          twelfth year of Akhenaten's reign, Nefertiti vanished, and no further
          mention of her exists. It is believed that she died and was buried in
          a tomb at Akhetaten. It is also thought that Tutankhamun later moved
          her mummy along with his father Akhenaten's when Akhetaten was
          abandoned.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Her tomb</b>
          <br />
          Egyptologists have been unable to determine the location of
          Nefertiti's tomb for years of research following the discovery of
          Tutankhamun's tomb. In 2015, Dr. Nicholas Reeves from the University
          of Arizona announced that he may have located the aforementioned
          queen's tomb and that she might have been secretly buried inside
          Tutankhamun's tomb. This is because scans revealed the possible
          existence of an entrance in Tutankhamun's tomb. This door might lead
          to Queen Nefertiti's burial place. Digital radar scanning showed
          traces of two locations that were once used as doors. Consequently,
          Reeves hypothesized the existence of a secret passage leading to other
          burial chambers. He stated that this is likely the reason why
          Tutankhamun's tomb is smaller than the other pharaohs' tombs in Egypt.
