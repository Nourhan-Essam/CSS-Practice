        <p>This element has a fixed width but its height is set to auto, meaning it adjusts based on the content inside.</p>
        <p>This is useful for dynamic content where the amount of text or other elements may vary.</p>

    <div class="combined-box">This box combines a responsive width with a fixed height. It adjusts its width based on the container but maintains a consistent height.</div>
