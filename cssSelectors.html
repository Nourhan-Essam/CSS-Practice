<p>"The Lottery" is a short story by Shirley Jackson that was first published in The New Yorker on June 26, 1948. The story describes a fictional small American community that observes an annual tradition known as "the lottery", which is intended to ensure a good harvest and purge the town of bad omens.

    <h2>Short story</h2>
    <p>If I found a magic carpet, I would fly to a magnificent castle in the clouds! As I take off, I can feel the wind rushing past me, and I see the world getting smaller below. When I land on the soft, fluffy clouds, I am amazed by the beautiful castle made of sparkling crystals.

The weather is perfect—it's sunny and warm, with a gentle breeze that makes the clouds feel like a cozy blanket. I see colorful rainbows arching across the sky and birds flying around, singing sweet songs.

Inside the castle, there are rooms filled with treasures like golden crowns and magical books. I can even see a garden full of giant flowers that glow in different colors! I would explore every corner of this magical place, feeling like a true adventurer. This would be the best day ever!</p>
<p>“Come on! It’s starting!” Greg, my neighbor, hollered from the sidewalk. 

“What’s starting?” I said. Behind him, groups of kids hurried down the street.  

We’d moved to the neighborhood just weeks before. I was shy; a bookworm, waiting for school to start. Greg was the only kid I’d met.

“The magic show!” said Greg, exasperated. “At Mr. Hale’s house!”

At the end of the Hales’ dirt driveway, rows of kids were seated on the grass.

White-haired and very thin, Mr. Hale wore a black top-hat and tails. In his hand he gripped a wand, producing doves from an urn. He asked for a volunteer to be sawed in half. I raised my hand. No one breathed.

“Just relax,” Mr. Hale whispered. “There’s nothing to it.” I got into the box and held my breath.

A collective gasp went up. And when I emerged in one piece, I was a star.</p>

    <h3>Another short story</h3>
    <p>“How’d he get in there?” said Amy, peering into the opening in the basement wall with her hands cupped around her eyes.

“Got me,” I said, taking a look. Barney, our 18-pound Maine Coon, peered up at me with his yellow eyes. The cat had squeezed his massive frame through an opening in the wall that an animal half his size would have had trouble with. He was trapped. 

“What are we going to do?” said Amy. “We can’t just leave him there.”  </p>
<p>A metallic aroma, the scent of panic, perfumed the damp cellar air. She was right. We couldn’t leave him. But we wouldn’t get him out without tearing down the wall, and we were only summer tenants.

The cat let out a mournful meow.  

“Barney’s going to die!” Amy cried. 

So, I brushed the tears away from her little cheeks and grabbed the hammer from the toolbox.</p>
