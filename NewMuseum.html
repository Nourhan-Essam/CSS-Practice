                  The statue of Ramses II was moved in the early 1950s and
                  placed in one of Cairo’s most famous squares, **Bab Al-Hadid
                  Square**, which was later renamed **Ramses Square**. On
                  **August 25, 2006**, the statue was relocated from its
                  prominent location in central Cairo, in front of the main
                  railway station, to the **Giza pyramids area** for restoration
                  work that lasted about a year, pending the completion of the
                  **Grand Egyptian Museum**.

                <p class="excerpt">
                  The significance of King Tutankhamun’s collection lies in
                  several key aspects. First, the treasure of Tutankhamun is the
                  most complete royal treasure ever discovered, unmatched in
                  history. It consists of 358 pieces, including the magnificent
                  golden mask and three anthropoid coffins, one made of solid
                  gold and the other two of gilded wood. Second, these artifacts
                  date back to the Eighteenth Dynasty, the most prosperous and
                  celebrated period of the New Kingdom, when Egypt opened to the
                  regions of the ancient Near East through military campaigns
                  and trade exchanges involving raw materials, manufactured
                  goods, and the flourishing work of craftsmen and artists.
                  Third, this vast collection remained entirely in Egypt,
                  providing a detailed picture of how a royal tomb was prepared
                  and furnished. It includes everyday objects such as dolls and
                  toys, complete furniture, tools and weapons, statues of
                  deities connected with funerary rituals, and the famous silver
                  and copper trumpets of Tutankhamun. All these treasures are
                  now housed in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. Finally, this
                  remarkable treasure reveals much about the king’s personal
                  life — his passion for hunting, his relationship with his wife
                  Ankhesenamun (believed to be his relative), and insights into
                  his court, officials, and artistic achievements. Among the
                  items is also the only surviving royal throne from ancient
                  Egyptian civilization.

                  Hatshepsut was one of the most famous queens to rule Egypt and
                  was considered a woman of great beauty. She is believed to

                  **congenital deformity in her fingers** (having six or more on
                  each hand). This fact was only discovered after her **mummy**
                  was examined, as in most of her **statues**, her hands
                  appeared normal — she had instructed sculptors to depict them
                  that way. She was also the **first to decorate gloves with
                  precious stones**.

        <p>
          <em
            >Ramses II (c. 1303 BC — July or August 1213 BC), also known as
            Ramses the Great, was the third pharaoh of Egypt’s Nineteenth
            Dynasty (reigned 1279 – 1213 BC). He is regarded as the most famous
            and powerful pharaoh of the Egyptian Empire. His successors and
            later rulers called him the “Great Ancestor.” Ramses II led several
            military campaigns into the Levant, restoring Egyptian control over
            Canaan, and also launched expeditions south into Nubia, where two of
            his sons accompanied him, as recorded on the walls of the Beit
            el-Wali temple.</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Ramses was appointed crown prince at the age of fourteen by his
          father, Seti I. It is believed he ascended the throne in his late
          teens and ruled Egypt from 1291 BC to 1213 BC for a total of 78 years
          and two months, according to both Manetho and contemporary Egyptian
          records. Some sources claim he lived to 99 years, though most scholars
          estimate he died at 90 or 91. If he became pharaoh in 1279 BC, as most
          Egyptologists believe, he would have ascended the throne at age 31 in
          1279 BC, based on the date of his coronation in the third harvest
          season, day 27. Ramses II celebrated fourteen “Sed festivals” — a
          jubilee first held after thirty years of reign and then every three
          years — the most of any pharaoh. Upon his death, he was buried in a
          tomb in the Valley of the Kings, but his mummy was later moved to the
          royal cache, where it was discovered in 1881. Today, it is displayed
          at the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization. The early years of
          his reign focused on constructing cities, temples, and monuments. He
          founded the city of Pi-Ramesses in the Nile Delta as his new capital
          and main base for campaigns in Syria. The city was built on the ruins
          of Avaris, the former Hyksos capital, and became the site of his
          principal temple complex. He is also known by the Greek name
          Ozymandias, a Hellenized rendering of part of his throne name meaning
          “The powerful truth of Ra, the chosen of Ra.”

            >Tutankhamun was one of the pharaohs of ancient Egypt’s Eighteenth
            Dynasty, ruling from 1334 BC to 1325 BC. He is among the most famous
            pharaohs, not because of great achievements or military victories
            like other rulers, but for historical reasons — most notably, the
            discovery of his tomb and treasures completely intact.</em

        <p>
          The mystery surrounding his early death has long fascinated
          historians. Many considered it unusual for a pharaoh to die so young,
          especially given evidence of fractures in his thigh bone and skull.
          His minister’s marriage to his widow and subsequent self-coronation
          added further intrigue. These mysterious events, combined with the
          widespread use of the “Curse of the Pharaohs” legend linked to his
          tomb — often depicted in films and video games — made Tutankhamun one
          of the most famous figures in ancient Egyptian history. Some even
          regard his death as one of the earliest known assassinations in human
          history. Tutankhamun died at a young age and was buried in his tomb,
          KV62, in the Valley of the Kings. He became pharaoh at around nine
          years old. His name in ancient Egyptian means “the living image of the
          god Amun,” the chief deity of ancient Egypt. Tutankhamun lived during
          a transitional period following Akhenaten, who had attempted to
          replace Egypt’s traditional polytheism with the worship of a single
          god. Under Tutankhamun, Egypt returned to the old religious practices.
          His tomb was discovered in 1922 in the Valley of the Kings by British
          archaeologist Howard Carter, an event that drew worldwide attention
          and remains one of the greatest archaeological discoveries of all
          time.

        <p>
          <em
            >Hatshepsut, also known as Ghnemet Amun or Hatshepsut, the Beloved
            of Amun and the Foremost of Noble Ladies (c. 1505–1458 BC), was one
            of the most prominent and powerful queens to rule Egypt. She was the
            sixth pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty, ruling first as a regent
            and later as a sole ruler from around 1479 BC to 1458 BC (according
            to the low chronology). She was also the Great Royal Wife of Pharaoh
            Thutmose II. Hatshepsut is considered the second confirmed woman to
            rule Egypt with full pharaonic authority, after Sobekneferu of the
            Twelfth Dynasty.</em

          The daughter of Thutmose I and Queen Ahmose, Hatshepsut initially
          ruled as regent for her young stepson Thutmose III, who inherited the
          throne at the age of two following the death of his father and her
          half-brother, Thutmose II. After several years of regency, she assumed
          full pharaonic power, adopting the complete royal titulary and ruling
          jointly with Thutmose III. To solidify her authority in a
          male-dominated society, she adopted traditional male roles and
          iconography, appearing in statues and reliefs with masculine features
          and wearing the pharaoh’s regalia, symbolizing herself as both the
          mother and father of Egypt. Her reign was marked by peace, prosperity,
          and artistic flourishing. Hatshepsut was one of the most prolific
          builders in ancient Egyptian history, commissioning grand construction
          projects such as the Karnak Temple complex, the Red Chapel, and the
          Speos Artemidos, with her most famous monument being her mortuary
          temple at Deir el-Bahari. Hatshepsut is believed to have died in the
          22nd year of Thutmose III’s reign. Toward the end of his rule and
          during that of his son Amenhotep II, efforts were made to erase her
          legacy from history — her statues were destroyed, inscriptions
          defaced, and many of her achievements re-attributed to other pharaohs.
